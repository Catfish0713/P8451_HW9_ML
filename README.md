Using the demonstration code from today's class, repeat the analysis with the following changes.

1. Use up sampling

2. Consider any changes you want to make to input features for the different algorithms

3. Tune hyperparameters further to try to improve model performance.

You should turn in the following for the assignment

1. Turn in a final knit version of your results, clearly showing the pre and post calibration plots for both svc and rf and the original logistic regression plot.

2. Describe your choice of final "optimal" model including why you believe it is the best model. If you decide none of your final models are "optimal", clearly describe why.

3. Describe at least one additional evaluation you would perform if the goal was to implement this model within a clinical setting.
